# NYT-Solutions

The New York Times has quite a few word games besides [Wordle](https://github.com/Strevia/WordleStuff). This repository is a catalog of the other New York Times Games I have attempted to solve. Included is:

- Letterboxed (Complete, solves with both two words and three or more without letter repetition)

- Digits (Complete, shows fewest moves)

- Spelling Bee (Complete, Wordlist seems to be incomplete)
